## #FUNCTION###

#EXAMPLE "print()"
#Function format "function()"

num_char = len("Hello")
print(num_char)

#starting a funtion with "def"

def my_function():
    print("Hello")
    print("Bye")

#to call function  type name of function and add "()" and put the inputs in the "(inputs)"

#EXAMPLE

my_function()

#def my_function():
#Do this
#Then do this
#Finally do this

#functions are a group of instructions

#INDENTATION#
#Whatever that is indented  will be part of the funtion#
# def my_function():
#     print()

# #FOR LOOP#
# for item in list_of_items:
    # do somthing to each item

#example
# for number in range(a,b):
#     print(number)

#While Loop#

# while somthing_is_true:
    #Do this
    #Then do this
    #Then do this

    #do something repeatedly
    #only whe the statement is false it will stop

# For loop is good for iterating to something and do something with each thing you iterate

#example1

# fruits = ["Apple","Pear","Orange"]

# for fruit in fruits:
#     print(fruit)

#example2

# for n in range(1,6):
#     print(n)

#While Loops are simply want to carry out something with condition

#while loops are will continue to do somthing as long as it becomes false and can cause infinte loops
